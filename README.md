# open-NLP

My implement of some classic NLP model

The folder `seq2seq ` is the tutorial version from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0s0f995w14&list=PLhhyoLH6Ijfyl_VMCsi54UqGQafGkNOQH&index=3&t=1947s

and can't run correctly now because some versions changed and it is so complexed to fix

So, I creat my implement using Hugging Face, the codes are in the  `seq2seq_hf`
